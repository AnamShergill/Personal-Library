# **Personal Library Manager 📚**

## **Overview**
This is a **command-line** based Personal Library Manager built using **Python** and the `rich` library. The program allows you to manage your book collection by letting you **add** 📖, **remove** 🗑️, **search** 🔍, and **view statistics** 📊 on your books. The library data is **saved to a file** (`library.txt`) so it persists across sessions 💾.

## **Features**
- **Add a Book** 📚: Add books with details like title, author, year, genre, and read status ✅.
- **Remove a Book** 🗑️: Remove books by title.
- **Search for a Book** 🔍: Search by title or author.
- **Display All Books** 📑: View all books in the library.
- **Display Statistics** 📊: View total number of books and the percentage of books that have been read.
- **File Handling** 💾: Save and load the library from a `library.txt` file.
