# **Personal Library Manager**

## **Overview**
This is a **command-line** based Personal Library Manager built using **Python** and the `rich` library. The program allows you to manage your book collection by letting you **add**, **remove**, **search**, and **view statistics** on your books. The library data is **saved to a file** (`library.txt`) so it persists across sessions.

## **Features**
- **Add a Book**: Add books with details like title, author, year, genre, and read status.
- **Remove a Book**: Remove books by title.
- **Search for a Book**: Search by title or author.
- **Display All Books**: View all books in the library.
- **Display Statistics**: View total number of books and the percentage of books that have been read.
- **File Handling**: Save and load the library from a `library.txt` file.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- `rich` library (for colorful output)

### **Install the Requirements**
```bash
pip install rich
